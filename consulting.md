Large data or small data? Helping users make decisions under uncertainty? Deciding whether machine learning may even help in a given context?

I mainly consult via collaborations where the shared goal is an academic publication that develops intellectual property. Where needed, I bring in friends and collaborators in machine learning, full-stack development, user research, and design. Previous projects include:

* For [The Browser](http://thebrowser.com/), developed an [end-to-end machine learning solution](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2682/short2.pdf) to make the editorial process more efficient.

* With data from the [Lose It! app](https://loseit.com/), built a food recommendation system that scales to hundreds of thousands of users and tens of millions of datapoints.

* For a metabolomics lab, helped build performant and interpretable machine learning [solutions](https://ml4molecules.github.io/papers2020/ML4Molecules_2020_paper_17.pdf) to identify molecules in biological samples from mass spectrometry instruments. Applications include blood, stool, biomarker, and food analysis.

* For arXiv.org data, developed state-of-the-art recommender system described in Chapter 4 of [my thesis](https://jaan.io/papers/altosaar-2020-thesis.pdf). 

* Contributed initial UI/UX design research and prototypes for [CANImmunize](https://www.canimmunize.ca/), which is used for the roll-out of Canada's COVID-19 vaccine.

* Helped a friend who teaches in DC design a Google sheets solution to replace [ClassDojo](https://www.classdojo.com/) that scales to 1000 students and 100 teachers. We designed a week-long user study with 137 students and 8 teachers to test the prototype.

* For clinical notes in hospital electronic health records, helped develop a system to [predict readmission](https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/11/ai-predicts-hospital-readmission-rates-from-clinical-notes/).


Feel free to reach out if you think we might work together: [j@jaan.io](mailto:j@jaan.io). I'm especially interested in helping build machine learning solutions for areas in **mental health** and **behavior change**.
